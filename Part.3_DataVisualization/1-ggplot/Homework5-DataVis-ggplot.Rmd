<br/>

#### Necessary items:
- **libraries:** tidyverse, ggsci, ggforce, patchwork, Hmisc
- **files:** bloom_df.csv, hw_task2_blank.png

Within RStudio you can directly edit these blocks of code and turn in your homework that way with your code and figures printed.   
I **HIGHLY** recommend getting your code to work in a normal R script then just copy and pasting the final code over to this document

**First: import libraries, set your working directory, and read in bloom_df**  
```{r init, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(ggforce) 
library(ggsci)
library(patchwork)
library(Hmisc)

setwd('~/g/Classes/DataScience/data_vis/') #change to match your ggplot directory

bloom_df <- read.csv('bloom_df.csv')
```

### bloom_df contents
- **taxa:** genus_species
- **genus** 
- **species** 
- **logbodysize** 
- **trophic_position**
- **reg:** diadromous or non-diadromous

Let's take a peak and look at the structure
```{r bloom_df}
bloom_df[1:5,]
str(bloom_df)
```

### Graphical tasks

This next tasks are going to ask you to make a series of figures. For each one, I would like you to make all of them *look good*. Change the theme around, change the axis labels, etc. Additionally, each of these will use the **reg** column which has 2 factors. Change the color and/or shape of them both. 

### Task 1: Continuous vs. continuous plot

Create two scatterplots of logbodysize vs. trophic_position grouped by reg

##### First plot: 
- a 2 trend lines (method = 'lm'), one for each reg variable

```{r 1.1}
#plot 1.1
```

##### Second plot 
- a single trend line for the whole model

```{r 1.2}
#plot 1.2
```

### Task 2: Continuous vs. categorical

##### The layout will be: 
- 2 panels: trophic_position and logbodysize  
- x axis: reg  
- y axis: value of trophic_position and logbodysize  

##### Create 4 plots:  
- bar and error bars (mean and 95% conf. int.)  
- point and error bars (mean and 95% conf. int.)  
- box plots  
- raw data + point and error bars (mean and 95% conf. int.)  

All these plots should have the same general layout but change the type of plot to visualize the data. 

**HINT:** logbodysize and trophic_position need to be turned into long format  

##### Example layout:   
![sample layout for task2](hw_task2_blank.png){width=50%}

```{r 2.1}
#plot 2.1
```

```{r 2.2}
#plot 2.2
```

```{r 2.3}
#plot 2.3
```

```{r 2.4}
#plot 2.4
```

### Task 3: layering your plots

Take your two favorite figures that you made and put them together using *patchwork* or *ggarrange* 

Feel free to make any other figure you want with this data and include it here. Have fun with it, play around. 

```{r 3}
#plot 3
```
